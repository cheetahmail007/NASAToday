# Astronomy Picture of the Day by Abhishek Pathak

## Notes

 * Unsuccessful responses like errors are discarded for now. For example, the app will allow you 
   to select current date but it may not have an entry in the Apod database and this result would
   be discarded for now.
 * When the app is started the data for the current date is downloaded automatically once a day.
 * I have decided not to download data which contains videos instead of an image. Some days may
   have videos which will not be saved in the database.
 * The calendar button will always re-download the data for the requested date. It is an 
   intentional feature.
